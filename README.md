# MacroLibX

A rewrite of School 42's MiniLibX using SDL2 and Vulkan. The goal of this version is to give a light, fast and modern graphical tool while keeping the same API as the version currently used at 42.

# Installation

## Linux

1. Necessary packages :

For Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
~ sudo apt update
~ sudo apt install libsdl2-2.0-0 libsdl2-dev build-essential
```

For Arch based distros
```bash
~ sudo pacman -S sdl2
```

2. Get MacroLibX

```bash
~ git clone https://github.com/420verfl0w/MacroLibX.git
~ cd MacroLibX
~ make
```

3. Compile your project

If you didn't disable Xpm support you'll have to link `libXpm`. You can remove it if you used `#define MLX_NO_XPM` before including `mlx.h`
```bash
clang myApp.c MacroLibX/libmlx.so -lSDL2 -lXpm
```
